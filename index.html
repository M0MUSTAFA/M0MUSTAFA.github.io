            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T State University, graduating in May 2026, with a strong passion for data science and application development. Currently, I am a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, where I develop AI applications using tools like Firebase, CSS, HTML, React.js, and APIs. My technical skills include Python, Java, and Microsoft tools, enhanced by experiences in teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership.</p>
            <p>
                Previously, as a Media Creator Intern, I produced engaging video content and analyzed metrics to boost social media engagement. I have also excelled in hackathons, including Rockwell Automation at NCAT and Thermo Fisher Mind Your Business Leadership Summit Mini Hackathon, and am actively involved in NSBE and Code House.
            </p>
            These experiences have sharpened my technical  abilities, and I am eager to continue contributing to the tech community.

                        triggered security alerts with multiple failed login attempts. The infrastructure maintains
